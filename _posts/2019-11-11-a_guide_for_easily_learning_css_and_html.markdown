There are a lot of tools in web browsers like Chrome and code editors such as Atom or Microsoft VSCode that make it easy for someone who is new to be able to jump right in and get started writing code. Many people have no idea of the vast scope and capability of Chromes developer tools that are built right into the browser. I'm going to talk about some of these tools and how they helped me get excited about two languages, in particular, CSS and HTML. First, let's talk about how much of the learning curve associated with those languages is undercut by the implementation of a code editor.

When I first decided to learn programming one of the first places I started to look was free online boot camps.  Some of these courses were great and easy to use tools for learning the fundamentals of programming. However, at the time, I did not realize the importance of using a code editor such as Atom or VSCode. Before using my own editor I was always discontented with the structure and syntax of HTML.  It just seemed to take the fun out of it. Then there's CSS... I know I'm not alone when I say that CSS can seem a little unintuitive and unwieldy at times. So the two languages that style and mark-up the web as we know always seemed like a no-fun hassle to dive into and actually build anything I thought would be worth building. However, recently I have begun to jump back into these languages but this time with a tool belt equipped with a code editor and a knowledge of how to use various developer tools found in Chrome. 


### How does a code editor make writing HTML/CSS easier and more enjoyable?

If you're like me, you are a lazy programmer. That goes to say that you like anything that makes programming faster and easier. If that's the case for you then I have great news. Making the whole experience faster and easier is exactly the type of thing that code editors were made for! From auto-fills to color tabs that allow you to pick a color and then give you the hexadecimal value of that; there are a huge number of tools that make the experience, I dare say, an enjoyable one. I am particularly fond of the autofill when writing HTML tags. All you have to do is start to type the name of the tag and hit the 'Tab' key and the carrots and closing tag are auto-filled for you!  Just with ```! ```  and pressing the 'Tab' key VSCode will give you this >

``` <!-- 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html> 
-->```
as you can see; the basic structure of an html document has been built for you.

On the CSS side of things it's the same story.  When typing in a type property, you get a full list of available options. You can even choose a color from an interactive color wheel that types in the RGB values once you make your choice. There are many features I have yet to discover but with just these alone my entire HTML/CSS experience has been changed forever.

### Chrome and Developer Tools

The DevTools UI can be a little overwhelming... there are so many tabs! But, if you take some time to get familiar with each tab to understand what's possible, you may discover that DevTools can seriously boost your productivity. There are many ways to open DevTools, because different users want quick access to different parts of the DevTools interface.  When you want to work with the DOM or CSS, right-click an element on the page and select Inspect to jump into the Elements panel. Or press Command+Option+C (Mac) or Control+Shift+C (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).
When you want to see logged messages or run JavaScript, press Command+Option+J (Mac) or Control+Shift+J (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS) to jump straight into the Console panel. 

One of the most useful tools is the elements panel.

This panel allows you to select different elements and reveals the HTML source for that element. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster. I don't know how I ever got by without all of these tools.
